### Other Notes

* `Multiple Key Rotation`

* `Batch File Translation`
  > Simply place all files that need translation into the input folder. It also supports multi-folder structures.

* `Configuration Migration`
  > Configuration information is stored in `resource/config.json`. When you download a new version, you can copy this file to the `resource` folder of the new version.
